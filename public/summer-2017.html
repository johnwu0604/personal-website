                <p class="text-muted">
                    Hey There! Thanks for checking out my summer 2017 blog page! For those who don't already know, I was selected this year to be part the
                    <a href="http://www.cansbridgefellowship.com/">Cansbridge Fellowship</a>. In summary, the fellowship is a program which aims to foster
                    young entrepreneurs by immersing them into challenging environments, connecting them to a supportive network,
                    and accelerating their growth to realize their aspirations. As a result, this will lead to quite an exciting summer ahead of me
                    and I'll be using this page to document my journey. My summer will begin in May at the Cansbridge Fellowship
                    Conference (CFC) in the San Francisco Bay Area. This will be the kick-off to my journey and a chance to explore the dream
                    destination of every tech entrepreneur. Following the conference, I'll be living in Tokyo, Japan and working for a startup called Flickfit for
                    three months. Going into a completely foreign country, I'll be pushing myself outside of my
                    comfort zone and be challenged to rebuild my support network from scratch. Upon finishing my internship, I'll be travelling through Asia for about
                    a month and visiting as many different countries as possible. This will be my final chance to truly push my limits and to learn as much
                    as possible while being abroad. I'm hoping to post occasional updates about my experience here,
                    so stay tuned for my first article!</p>

                <hr class="intro-divider">
                <p><i>May 14, 2017</i></p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    In May of 2010, coming fresh out of my first high school basketball season, I had showcased my skills enough to be selected for the local club team (<a href="http://www.athelitebasketball.com/">Athelite Basketball</a>). This was a unique chance to be part of an elite team that would spend the summer competing at various tournaments in order to continue our development during the off-season. Our first tournament was in Seattle, and for most of us, our first taste at American level competition. Upon walking into the location of our first game, we were amazed: a first class facility split into 10+ courts, coolers full of free gatorade, and college scouts on every corner. Once the game had ended, we were stunned: bruises on every part of our body, completely out of breath, and a 50+ point loss. We were some of the better players north of the border with a unique opportunity to experience the atmosphere
                    in the States, but it was clear we had a lot of work to do in order to compete at the same level. This kept us humble, yet motived. <br> <br>

                    7 years later now as a tech geek and aspiring entrepreneur, I managed to experience some parallel comparisons when visiting the silicon valley for the Cansbridge Fellowship Conference. Uncomparable working environments, outstanding salaries, and sunny California weather were some of the perks I got to witness, but the fierce competition and standards to be able to make it to the valley did not go unnoticed. Myself along with the other Cansbridge Cohort have had accomplishments within Canada, but witnessing the ecosystem in the valley has inspired all of us to go beyond the Canadian market to compete at a global scale. <br><br>

                    My 10 day stay in San Francisco was definitely an eye-opening experience and a teaser to how much more I can experience by leaving the comfort zone that is in Canada. The week consisted of touring offices and exploring the bay area while working on a startup pitch that was presented to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bwertz/">Boris Wertz</a> (one of the top tech angel investors in North-America). However, the best and most important part of the week was getting to know the Cansbridge Fellowship Network which consists of not just some of the top minds through Canada, but also some of the most genuine people who I have ever met. I got to learn about how the program began in Queen's University just six years ago, has since grown into a nation-wide network of leaders, and has the potential to continue growing for years to come. After experiencing more of what Cansbridge truly is, I feel extremely lucky to be part of this fellowship and I look forward to where my life will take me as a result! <br><br>

                    Next up, the Cansbridge 2017 Cohort will be spending the summer working in various parts of Asia. I'll be working in Tokyo, so if anyone is in the area, feel free to reach out to me! And if you are one of the cohorts reading this, good luck with your journey :)</p>

                <hr class="intro-divider">
                <p><i>June 1, 2017</i></p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    Note: This article can also be found on Medium: <a hreh="https://medium.com/@johnwu0604/feeling-some-empathy-eb0dc7a2ce9f"/>https://medium.com/@johnwu0604/feeling-some-empathy-eb0dc7a2ce9f</a> <br><br>

                    As a first generation Canadian and the oldest sibling, I have always been the designated translator in the family growing up. I would have to help everyone order their dishes at a restaurant, be in charge of filling out application forms, and have the responsibility to book everything for family holidays. These were such simple tasks, but the fact that my parents were not able to accomplish them independently were one of my biggest pet peeves. Many arguments during my childhood would actually evolve from this topic, and sometimes I would just simply refuse to help. <br> <br>


                    Being in Tokyo and putting myself in their shoes, I can finally feel some true empathy for what they had to go through when moving to Canada. All the simple tasks that my parents needed help with, were not so simple anymore. I have no excuse though. My parents initially immigrated to a small town along the coast of Newfoundland not knowing a word of English (or Newfie language), and before the days of modern internet. I’m currently in a large metropolitan area with english text all around me, and mobile applications for everything that I would ever need. <br> <br>


                    Even despite the advantage, it has still been a challenge. During my first night in Tokyo, I went shopping for shampoo and would have ended up buying hair dye had I been too shy to ask someone for help. The next day, I spent over an hour walking the streets before being able to explain to a store clerk that I was looking for a sim card that fits my Google Pixel, which doesn’t exist in Japan and looks just like an iPhone. Later that night I went to a restaurant without an English menu and ended up ordering pig testicles mixed with raw eggs along with salamander. It actually didn’t taste too bad though! The adventure of trying to accomplish normal tasks are beyond exciting though, as you’ll never know what to expect. I’ve been refusing to use translation apps as well, which adds to the suspicion and has also forced me to interact with more people than I would otherwise. <br> <br>

                    Work has also not been easy, since I’m employed at a startup as a software engineer. One thing about Japan that is clear is that people work much harder. You can basically imagine how tech startups in North America work, and then bring that to another level called Asia. The hours are long, the work is challenging, and I’m required to fully invest into the success of the business — all of this along with the language barrier. But as an aspiring entrepreneur there is no better learning experience than this, and I would not have nearly as much responsibility working at any other company. Not to mention, the respect that all the employees here have for one another is unbelievable — they truly make you feel part of the family. <br> <br>

                    Nonetheless, the city of Tokyo has been shocking. It has the largest population for a metropolitan area, yet one of the lowest crime rates. The city is extremely large, but not much traffic relative to its size. Public garbage cans are impossible to find, yet litter on the ground is just as hard to spot. The streets are crowded, but everyone respects one another — bowing with every interaction. Much of the negatives you would expect from a large city simply does not exist in Tokyo. However, all the positives you would assume has exceeded expectations. This includes a subway network that looks like a plate of spaghetti when shown on a map, outstanding food from all parts of the world, and all the essentials you need within the smallest proximity you could imagine. <br> <br>

                    It has only been a few weeks here in Japan but it has been more than just overwhelming. The fact that I’m living in a city with more people than all of Canada is mind blowing. Everyday I’m experiencing something new and everywhere I go I’m learning something new from their culture. Living in a foreign country where you don’t know a single person to begin with is not easy, but it sure is exciting. Meanwhile, my parents have been constantly laughing at the culture shock that I’m facing — all of which they had to experience when they first immigrated to Canada… all of which I never understood until now. <br> <br>

                    Me: “Born and raised in Canada.” <br><br>
                    Person: “No, like where are you <i>really</i> from?” <br><br>
                    Me: “Well, I was born in Newfoundland, but I spent most of my life in BC.” <br><br>
                    Person: “Fine, where is your <i>family</i> from?” <br><br>
                    Me: [Sigh] <br><br>
                    We have all heard this conversation play out and anyone who grew up in North America would have witnessed this a handful of times in their lives. For a Canadian born Chinese like myself, it’s a conversation that has simply become a regular occurrence. Despite accepting that people will always ask me this question, it still irritates me each and every time. Most often it makes me wish that I didn’t physically appear different and stand out as a minority in North America. However, somewhat ironically, this wish has actually become a reality after spending 2 months in Japan. <br><br>
                    Physically different-looking foreigners usually get some sort of special treatment in many countries in Asia and Japan is no exception. Locals often ask them for photos, amazed by their foreign looks and envious of the fact that they can speak English. When they seem lost, it won’t take long until someone notices and tries to give assistance. Upon walking into restaurants, they are immediately given an English menu and spoken to in English. If they can speak a few words in Japanese, the locals are quite fascinated. And most importantly, locals overlook or discount actions that break any cultural norms because it is clear that they aren’t native. <br><br>
                    For me however, I don’t get the same privilege. Although my ancestral background is Chinese and I don’t speak a word of Japanese, people still assume that I’m a local at first glance. When I’m walking on the streets or looking for directions, I blend in with the crowd and able to go unnoticed. Everywhere I go, I’m spoken to in Japanese and given a perplexed look when they discover that I don’t know the language. When I forget minor cultural gestures like bowing or don’t adhere to Japanese table manners, I’m given harsh stares. When I break minor laws on the streets (ones that I don’t know about), I’m immediately scolded by those around me. <br><br>
                    I may be a foreigner, but my ethnicity makes me appear otherwise. However, it hasn’t always been bad to be able to blend in with the Japanese population. I’ve gotten into many restaurants that usually refuse to serve foreigners. I don’t have to worry about people watching my every move in public. I’m able to develop more meaningful relationships with locals, since our initial interactions aren’t purely based on the fact that I’m not from Japan. And the expectation for me to follow their traditions has forced me to truly embrace the culture that lives in the country. <br><br>
                    Although not looking like a minority has its benefits, it made me realize that looking ethnically different is what truly made me who I am today. It’s nice being able to blend in with the native Japanese people, but much harder to make myself noticed in the society. In Canada, I hated being a minority, but coming to Japan has made me realize that it was in fact a good thing after all. It was so much easier to stand out from the rest of the crowd and my presence was easily noticed. Whether it be trying out for sports teams, campaigning for student elections, or going through job interviews, my appearance made it simple for people to remember who I was and made it easy to distinguish me from the rest of the candidates. Growing up in majority caucasian communities, I can’t deny that have I never faced discrimination. In fact, my whole life has consisted of dealing with racism. However, for the most part, I had been given more attention than others and it was always up to me how I would use it to my advantage. <br><br>
                    Now that I’m in a place where people automatically assume I’m from Japan, it surprisingly brings excitement when people find out I’m actually a foreigner and asks where I’m from. In fact, the conversation nowadays usually go like this: <br><br>
                    Person: “So, where are you from?” <br><br>
                    Me: “Canada!! And yes, our country just turned 150 years old! And yes, we have the coolest Prime Minister in the world right now! And yes, I love poutine and maple syrup!” <br><br>
                    Person: “Woah, Sugoi ne!” < Translation: Wow, that’s amazing! > <br><br>
                    Me: “Oh, and my parents were originally from China! So I speak Cantonese too!” <br><br>
